This bot scrapes different websites for new releases in journal articles related to Quantitative Psychology. 
Currently, we are scraping from:
- Quantitative Psychology and Measurement
- Applied Psychological Measurement
- Psychological Methods
- Psychological Assessment
- British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology
- Journal of Mathematical Psychology


Sadly, there are very few Quantitative Psychology journals out there, but we will be deploying code that searches for relevant articles in other journals in the near future.

The quantpsybot is the first iteration of a series of Twitterbots dedicated to mining journal websites and is directly related to @cogpsybot and @cogagingbot.
